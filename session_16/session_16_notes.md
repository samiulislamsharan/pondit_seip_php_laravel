# Session 16: Composer, Namespace, Autoload

In the PHP world, namespaces are designed to solve two problems that authors of libraries and applications encounter when creating re-usable code elements such as classes or functions:

1. Name collisions between code you create, and internal PHP classes/functions/constants or third-party classes/functions/constants.
2. Ability to alias (or shorten) Extra_Long_Names designed to alleviate the first problem, improving readability of source code.
